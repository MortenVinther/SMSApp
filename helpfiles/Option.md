#### Here you can change how the prediction is done:


**Final year** set the last year of the forecast. 


**F model** defines rules for dynamic setting a forecast Fishing mortality as a function of stock size. Mainly relevant for stochastic recruitment, with highly variable biomasses.  


**Other predators** change the abundance of "other predators" and thereby their predation on prey species.


**Exploitation pattern** change the relativ F, for example choose to fish less on the youngest ages.


**Recruitment** defines how recruitments are derived from the stock-recruitment relation. In deterministic mode, recruitments are without the natural variability, while stochastic recruitment includes the variability observed in the historic SMS.

**Set/reset options** Here you can set (save) options or reset options from the last set (save).
